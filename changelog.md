# Unreleased

Fixes:
* Fix an issue where the drag external and move external action were always output even if the drag was entirely within the tree. Closes issue #28
* When dragging multiple nodes some nodes where represented multiple times in the source vector. This no longer happens. Reported by @hydra.
